PHP Hooks API is a way to load the plug-in scripts through hook which is embedded in main program. This API can be used to setup and embed third party Plugins in main code streaming just like how it is done by `Wordpress Plugin AP<http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API>`_ .



1. Terminology
===============

**Plugin System:** Successful use of plugin system help you and third party developers to add additional functional modules to the main program by storing separate location(folder) instead of modifing the main code. It can freely dis/assemble these functions by add/delect Plugin folders without affecting the others. 

**Plugin:** Is a program, or a set of one or more functions, written in the codes stored in separate Plugin locations(folders), Plugin can freely add specific set of features or services to the main program. Plugin can be seamlessly integrated with the main program using access points(hooks). 

**Hook:** Hooks are provided by plugin system ,such as PHP Hooks API, to allow your plugin code to be 'hooked into' the main program.

**Apply Hook:** Tell the main program, where/when execute the 'hooked in' function scripts stored in particular separate plugin folder. 


2. How To Do
===============

Here is a example to illustrate how to use the plugin system.

**setup.php:** creating the database of plugin system by providing DB informatin properly, if you need to manage plugins by backend.

**control.php:** is a example of plugins control panel, you can manage the plugins dis/activity by backend.

**init.php:** is a initializing process to
 include phphooks class and create instance
 fetch the active plugins list from DB
 set/define hooks
 load/define plugin folder
 re-define functions for plugins

**example.php:** The example page to attach plugins which are stored in plugin folder by applying hooks.

**plugins(folder):** containing third party plugins.

**phphooks.class.php** phphooks class, you can include it to you programe to use this system.
